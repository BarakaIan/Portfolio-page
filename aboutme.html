            <p>Well, currently am studying Software Development in Moringa School.
                Prior to joining Moringa School, I was studying some free online classes, just to learn and obtain
                information about
                different subjects/areas in life.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>Having graduated from high school last year,have not encountered any job experience so far.</p>
        <h2>Why I chose programming.</h2>
        <p>Programming is a diverse and interesting field, and since at an early age, i was so fascinted about
            computers.
            I was yearning to know how computers work and i wanted to get the in-depth of it.As days go by and i
            finished high school,
            I started to discover things to do with Websites, Servers, Graphics and Web Designs.I was so
            obssesed
            abut
            them that I started to follow them slowly
            and just to get the knowledge of how it works, how its created and designed and how its set to
            perform a
            specific function.
            Its when after discovering the above questions, I decide to enrol at a coding school and i got to
            know
            about
            Moringa School and Its
            classes on Coding, hoping to get the best of it.
